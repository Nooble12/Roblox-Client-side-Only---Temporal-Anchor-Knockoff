A client-side only script that is basically a knockoff of Protea's Temporal Anchor from Warframe. Not optimized at all. Just something I threw together in about an hour for fun.

# Notice
This script was not designed with multiplayer in mind. As such, other players will not see the client moving during the backward time phase.

# How to install
Create a "local script" in the "StarterCharacterScripts" folder and paste the code. The default ability keybind is "x".
